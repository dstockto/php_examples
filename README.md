PHP 5.3 - 7.0 Examples
==================================

This repository contains various examples of some of the "new" features in PHP 5.3,
PHP 5.4, PHP 5.5, PHP 5.6 and now 7.0. It also contains some experiments that I ended
up abandoning for one reason or another. This is by no means production ready code.
It was built to show quick and easy to digest examples for a PHP meetup group. If
you put it in your web root or start the PHP built-in web server, you should see
a menu with the various code examples and running examples.

php -S 127.0.0.1:8000

Then browse to http://localhost:8000

If there's another feature you'd like to see examples for, please open an issue
or send a pull request.
